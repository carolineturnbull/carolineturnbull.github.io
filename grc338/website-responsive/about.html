            <h1>About Us</h1>
              <p>
                Founded in 2017 by husband and wife Jeff and Karen, Hi-Fi Espresso loves and adores all things Los Angeles. Having lived 1.5 of our combined 2 lives in this incredible city, we draw inspiration from the cinema, music and fashion of the 1970s.
              Certified as a member of California Green Business Network, we constantly strive to offer the highest quality, to lower our carbon footprint, and to protect our oceans. All dishes are vegetarian, with the exception of one pescatarian dish at our Redondo Beach shop. A small shop can make a big difference. As a family-owned, environmentally-friendly shop, we roast fresh weekly in downtown Los Angeles, and are truly fortunate to serve you. Be good to one another, and please enjoy. 
              </p>
              
            <h2>Health & Safety</h2>
              <p>
                Our utmost priority is to keep both you and our crew safe. Contactless ordering is possible online, masks are still required inside our shops, and socially-distanced seating is available both inside and outside on our patios.
              </p>
            <h2>Online Orders</h2>
              <p>
                For online orders, coffee is made to order upon arrival. All food orders of 3 or more dishes will most likely take longer than the default pickup time of 15 minutes. 
              </p>
            <h2>Our Kitchen</h2>
              <p>
                Food in our Redondo Beach shop is prepared in a kitchen where walnuts, raw eggs, and fish are present.
